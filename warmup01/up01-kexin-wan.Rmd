## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
## **Breakfast Burrito Recipe**

#### Why should we cook burrito?

As Lisi Harrison once said:

> A burrito is a delicious food item that breaks down all social barriers and leads to temporary spiritual enlightenment.

And that's exactly the reason why I choose burrito as my first food.


## **Quadratic Equation**
In algebra, a [quadritic Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) is any equation having the form:

> $$ a\times x^2 + b\times x+c=0 $$

where x represents an unknown/
and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0.

#### **Solving the Quadritic Equation**
[Completing the square](https:/] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula#Derivation_of_the_formula) for solving quadratic equations, called the **quadratic formula.**

>$$x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4\times a\times c}}{2\times a}$$
