R Markdown
----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. \#\# **Breakfast Burrito Recipe**

#### *Ingredients*

-   6 eggs
-   2 tablespoons OLD El Paso chopped chiles
-   1 to 2 tablespoons milk
-   fully cooked breakfast sausage links
-   1 bag refrigerated shredded potatoes
-   Old El Paso flour tortillas
-   2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend

#### *Kitchen tools needed*

-   Large bowl
-   **Skillet**
-   Paper Towel
-   **Foil**

#### *Steps to follow*

1.  In large bowl, beat 6 eggs, 2 tablespoons Old El Paso chopped green chiles and 1 to 2 tablespoons milk until well blended. In 10-inch skillet over medium heat, cook eggs, stirring occasionally, until scrambled. Stir in 6 fully cooked breakfast sausage links, cut into small pieces; heat until warm. Set aside.
2.  Cook 1 bag (1 lb. 4 oz.) refrigerated shredded hash brown potatoes as directed on bag; set aside.
3.  To assemble burritos, spoon line of hash browns down center of each of 6 Old El Paso flour tortillas for burritos. Top with 2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend and the scrambled eggs.
4.  Roll up each tortilla tightly to secure filling. Serve immediately, or freeze as directed below.
5.  To freeze, wrap each burrito in paper towel; wrap in foil. Freeze. To reheat, remove and discard foil. Microwave each frozen paper towel-wrapped burrito on High 2 minutes 30 seconds, turning burrito over halfway through heating.

#### Why should we cook burrito?

As Lisi Harrison once said:

> A burrito is a delicious food item that breaks down all social barriers and leads to temporary spiritual enlightenment.

And that's exactly the reason why I choose burrito as my first food.

**Quadratic Equation**
----------------------

In algebra, a [quadritic Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) is any equation having the form:

> *a* × *x*<sup>2</sup> + *b* × *x* + *c* = 0

where x represents an unknown/ and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0.

#### **Solving the Quadritic Equation**

\[Completing the square\](<https:/>\] (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula#Derivation_of_the_formula>) for solving quadratic equations, called the **quadratic formula.**

> $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4\\times a\\times c}}{2\\times a}$$
