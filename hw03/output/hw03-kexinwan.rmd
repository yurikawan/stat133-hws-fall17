## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r eval=FALSE} 
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

###Comments and Reflections
1. Was this your first time working on a project with such file structure? If yes, how do you feel about it?

Yes. It's really difficult to manage so many concepts and functions. But it's definitely worth trying.

2. Was this your first time using relative paths? If yes, can you tell why they are important for reproducibility purposes?

Yes. 

3. Was this your first time using an R script? If yes, what do you think about just writing code? 

No. It's not that flexible as Rmd.

4. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?

To understand the concept of principal component analysis and use them in R functions.

5.  What was easy(-ish) even though we haven???t done it in class/lab?

It's really easy to perform the arithmetic calculation.

6. Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?

No.

7. How much time did it take to complete this HW?

Around 6 hours.

8. What was the most time consuming part?

Understanding how to use R to perform principal component analysis.

9.Was there anything interesting?

Not really.
