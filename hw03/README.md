# HW03 - Summarizing Variables

From the logical point of view, the purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand, we want you to keep working
with data frames and producing plots but now using the packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2". On the other hand, we want you
to start working with a little bit more complex file structure.
